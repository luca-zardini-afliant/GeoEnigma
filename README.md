# üåç Global Enigma

A cross-platform geo-detective puzzle game built with Flutter. Test your geography knowledge by guessing locations around the world!

## üí° Project Idea

Global Enigma is an interactive geography puzzle game that challenges players to identify locations worldwide using progressive clues. The game combines educational value with entertainment, making geography learning engaging and fun.

**Core Concept**: Players are presented with a mystery location and must use strategic clue revelation to narrow down their guess. Each clue costs points, creating a risk-reward dynamic that encourages critical thinking and geographical knowledge.

**Key Innovation**: The progressive clue system allows players to choose their difficulty path - they can play conservatively with fewer clues or take risks for higher scores. The distance-based scoring system rewards precision while the achievement system provides long-term engagement.

**Educational Value**: Players naturally learn about world geography, landmarks, and cultural references through gameplay. The three difficulty levels (nations, cities, monuments) cater to different knowledge levels, making it accessible to both geography enthusiasts and casual learners.
